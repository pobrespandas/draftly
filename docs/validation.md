# Validation

Run `swift test` and `scripts/build-app.sh --local` before a release.

## Recorded interface check

On 2026-10-18, the local Debug app was checked with Computer Use on macOS 27.0.1.
The check covered capture with keyboard focus, Markdown editing, tags, save and
reopen, undo and redo, revision history, and a second independent window.
After comparison with the installed Drafts app, the check also covered repeated
empty capture without saved notes, saving after typing, selected-text task
conversion, undo from the editor bar, the command palette, group controls, and
the three-panel action inspector.

Directory import and native execution passed for Copy as Rich Text and Save in
Obsidian Vault. The exported Markdown file contained the expected content and
tags. A second export reported an existing file and did not overwrite it. The
global shortcut registered without an error. The full key combination created a
draft in the active app. Capture while another app is active still needs a check.

Live Reminders, Calendar, and Shortcuts calls still need the interface checks
below. The automated action suite uses a test host for those side effects.

## Automated checks

The suite checks persistence after reopening a store, immutable content revisions,
archive and trash filters, workspaces, backup restoration, conflict copies,
unsupported backup versions, UTF-16 selections, templates, HTML escaping, and
10,000 notes with a 100,000-character document.

Action tests check the five reference snapshots, shared script state,
cancellation, unsupported steps, failure on the final step, native permission
errors, and installation URL encoding. These tests do not call live services.

## Mac interface checks

1. Create a draft. Type Markdown and Unicode text. Check the save indicator.
2. Switch drafts, reopen the app, and check the saved text.
3. Undo and redo edits. Check that an action edit can also be undone.
4. Add tags and a flag. Search for the note. Save and select a workspace.
5. Archive, trash, and restore a draft. Test batch operations.
6. Restore a revision. Check that the later content remains in history.
7. Import each reference action from its directory URL. Inspect its steps.
8. Run Copy as Rich Text. Paste into a rich text editor.
9. Run Save in Obsidian Vault. Choose a temporary folder. Check the file. Run
   again and check that create mode does not overwrite it.
10. Test the global capture shortcut, menu bar, and two independent windows.
11. Export a full backup. Import it into a separate test store.
12. Test Markdown preview, Shortcuts, AppleScript, Reminders, and Calendar.
    Deny permissions first. Check that errors keep the source text.

Use `--ui-testing` to run with a separate temporary library and no iCloud.
Use `--local-only` to disable iCloud for a launch. These options do not delete
existing stores.

## iCloud acceptance gate

The first signing attempt failed because the available team was a Personal Team.
No iCloud container or live sync result is claimed.

After configuring a paid team, use two Macs with the same iCloud account:

1. Create and change notes, tags, workspaces, and actions on each Mac.
2. Confirm that both libraries converge.
3. Disconnect one Mac. Edit on both Macs. Reconnect it.
4. Confirm that the winning note and both saved content revisions are available.
5. Trash and restore a note. Confirm the result on the second Mac.
6. Disable network access and restart. Confirm that local editing still works.
7. Sign out of iCloud. Check the error state and local data.

CloudKit sync is eventual. The UI must not promise an immediate server save.
Create a backup before testing account changes or production schemas.

## Window transition regression checks

The DraftlyTests target covers failed capture with a saved draft and a temporary
draft. It also checks successful capture, workspace filter removal, draft
pinning, window floating, the new draft timeout, and preview transitions. Save failures use an
injected writer. These checks do not change the user's library.

For interface checks, open all four panels. Confirm that the footer buttons and
character count fit. Choose another group in the editor action bar. Confirm
that its action buttons appear. Toggle list preview, tags, and date options.
Restart the app and confirm that these options remain saved. Open Markdown
preview with the eye button below the editor. Confirm that it appears in the
center panel. Switch back to text with the eye button and Option-Command-P.
Check that the note content and selection remain unchanged.
